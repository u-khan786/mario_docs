IAM Role Configuration : Creating and attaching IAM roles and policies for secure access management. Repository Cloning : Cloning the Git repository containing the application and Terraform configuration files. EKS Cluster Deployment : Using Terraform to deploy the EKS cluster and related resources. Application Deployment : Deploying the containerized Super Mario game on the EKS cluster. Application Exposure : Exposing the application via a Kubernetes service and AWS Load Balancer. Deployment Verification : Verifying the successful deployment and operation of the application. Resource Cleanup : Deleting the Kubernetes deployment and destroying the EKS cluster to clean up resources. Technologies Used AWS Management Console The AWS Management Console provides a web-based user interface to manage AWS services and resources. It is used for launching EC2 instances, managing IAM roles, and monitoring deployed resources. Ubuntu Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution used as the operating system for the EC2 instance. It provides a stable and secure environment for installing and running the necessary tools. Windows Windows is used as the development machine for setting up and managing the project before deploying it to the cloud environment. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) IAM is used to create and manage AWS users and permissions. In this project, IAM roles and policies are configured to control access to EC2 and EKS resources securely. Terraform Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used to define and provision the AWS infrastructure required for this project. Terraform configuration files automate the creation of the EKS cluster, IAM roles, and policies. AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) The AWS CLI is a unified tool to manage AWS services from the command line. It is used for various tasks such as configuring the AWS environment and interacting with AWS services programmatically. kubectl kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It is used to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot applications running on the EKS cluster. Docker Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. The Super Mario game application is containerized using Docker and deployed on the EKS cluster. Git Git is a version control system used to manage the source code for the Super Mario game application and Terraform configuration files. The repository is cloned to the EC2 instance for deployment. S3 (Simple Storage Service) Amazon S3 is used to store the Terraform state files. Storing the state files in S3 ensures consistency and enables collaboration in a team environment. SSH Client An SSH client is used to securely connect to the EC2 instance for setup and management. Common examples include the terminal application on Unix-based systems and PuTTY on Windows. PuTTY PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer application used to connect to the EC2 instance from a Windows development machine. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor used for editing Terraform configurations, Dockerfiles, and other code related to the project. It provides extensions for syntax highlighting, code completion, and version control integration. Kubernetes Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud. It is used to launch and manage virtual servers where the necessary tools for deployment are installed. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Amazon VPC enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. It provides complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. Node Groups Node groups are a part of Amazon EKS and represent a group of worker nodes (EC2 instances) that are used to run Kubernetes pods. The nodes in a node group are managed as a single unit. Subnets Subnets are a range of IP addresses in your VPC. Subnets allow you to group resources based on security and operational needs. The EKS cluster is deployed within specific subnets. Terraform Cloud Terraform Cloud is a service provided by HashiCorp for remote Terraform execution, state management, and collaboration. It helps to securely store and manage the Terraform state files. GitHub Actions GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates the build, test, and deployment pipeline. It is used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the Super Mario game application. Installation instructions Launch Ubuntu instance Sign in to AWS Console : Log in to your AWS Management Console. Navigate to EC2 Dashboard : Go to the EC2 Dashboard by selecting \u201cServices\u201d in the top menu and then choosing \u201cEC2\u201d under the Compute section. Launch Instance : Click on the \u201cLaunch Instance\u201d button to start the instance creation process. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) : Select an appropriate AMI for your instance.
